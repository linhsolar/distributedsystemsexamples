# Lectures and Examples for Teaching Distributed Systems and Computer Networking

This git includes lectures and simple examples for teaching distributed systems
and computer networks for master/bachelor programs.

The material has been prepared for courses that I have carried out in various universities. Key references for lecture notes:
